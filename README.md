# Redmind front-end code assignment

## Task Description

You will be creating the UI for a minimalistic multiplayer battleships game using React and Typescript.

Clone and use this repository.

You may install and use any additional libraries you want.

Feel free to add interactions, animations, hover effects etc. but keep in mind the final outcome should look like similar to the design [Found here](https://www.figma.com/file/Ub8oaA72Q5A0lHgMxiDtmu/Redmind-Frontend-Test-Design?node-id=14%3A4).

The backend is already built using firebase and a multitude of helper functions are provided to you. These can be imported from the index file in the firebase directory.

Don't spend too much time completing the assignment but try to spend atleast 2 hours.
It's better (and totally fine) to deliver a small part that works and looks good rather than something with bugs that looks unfinished.

If you're having any issues getting started or general questions please contact us!

## Delivery

When you're finished make a pull request to this repository and let your contact at Redmind know.
